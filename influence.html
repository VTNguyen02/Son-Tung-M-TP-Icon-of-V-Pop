            Son Tung M-TP’s influence extended beyond the industry to his own family, inspiring his younger brother, Mono, to pursue a career in music. 
            Mono followed a similar path into V-Pop but made a deliberate choice to build his reputation without relying on his brother’s fame. 
            His debut projects showcased a distinct sound and image, proving his commitment to carving out an identity that was uniquely his own.
            </p>
            <p class="intro">
              Mono’s independence highlights the strength of Son Tung’s legacy. Rather than overshadowing his brother, Son Tung’s success created space for Mono to thrive 
              while still encouraging individuality. Together, they represent two different approaches to artistry within the same family, showing how Son Tung’s impact was 
              powerful enough to inspire but flexible enough to allow others to define their own creative journeys.
