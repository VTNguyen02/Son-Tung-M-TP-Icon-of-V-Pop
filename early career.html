            Beginnings and Early Passion
          </p>
          <div class="onethird" id="earlyimage"></div>
          <p class="intro">
            Son Tung M-TP was born in Thai Binh, a small province in northern Vietnam, into a family that valued education and tradition. 
            From a young age, he showed an unusual fascination with music, often singing along to popular songs and experimenting with melodies of his own. 
            </p>
            <p class="intro">His family noticed his talent early. Some relatives encouraged him to pursue this passion, while others were skeptical, worrying that music was not a stable or respectable career path. 
            Despite these mixed reactions, Son Tung remained determined, teaching himself to write lyrics and record demos. His persistence eventually led him into the underground music scene, 
            where he could share his work online and begin carving out his identity as an artist.

            Evolution of Sound and Challenges
          </p>
          <div class="onethird" id="earlyimage2"></div>
          <p class="intro">
            Within the underground community, Son Tung began blending pop melodies with hip-hop and R&B influences, creating a style that felt fresh compared to the mainstream Vietnamese sound. 
            His early tracks circulated widely online, sparking excitement among young listeners but also criticism from traditional audiences who felt his music was too unconventional. 
          </p>
          <p class="intro">
            Breaking into the industry was far from easy. He faced skepticism from professionals who doubted his staying power and accusations of copying Western trends. 
            Yet his creativity, catchy hooks, and bold fashion choices helped him stand out. Even when his family worried about the risks of pursuing music full-time, 
            his determination and growing fanbase proved that he was capable of building something new and lasting.

            Early Performances and Stage Presence
          </p>
          <div class="onethird" id="earlyimage3"></div>
          <p class="intro">
            Son Tung’s first performances were in modest settings such as school events, local competitions, and underground showcases where he tested his songs in front of small audiences. 
            These early appearances revealed his natural charisma and confidence, qualities that quickly distinguished him from other young performers. 
          </p>
          <p class="intro">
            His family, initially cautious about his 
            ambitions, began to see how his stage presence and ability to connect with crowds were winning over fans. Even in these humble venues, his energy, fashion sense, and 
            fearless attitude created a buzz that spread beyond Thai Binh. These performances gave him the momentum to move toward larger stages, proving to both his supporters and 
            skeptics that he was destined for something bigger.
